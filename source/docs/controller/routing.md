# Routing

When requests come they are routed to the correct controller. You configure routes in the `config\routes.php` file.

To add a route you use the Router add method.

```php
Router::add($route,$options);
```

Lets look at some real examples.

You prefer a user does not see the controller and action in the url , this example will take all requests to `/login` and send it to the users controller and call the action `login`.

```php
Router::add('/login', ['controller' => 'Users', 'action' => 'login']);
```


You want all requests to / to display a page using the pages controller.

```php
Router::add('/', ['controller' => 'Pages', 'action' => 'display', 'home']);
```

You want to parse the url in a certain way using variables. `:controller` for controller and `:action` for action. This is the default routing that is used in the framework, you can remove this and then only setup routes for what you want.

```php
Router::add('/:controller/:action/*');
```

For example if you only wanted to route for the posts controller.

```php
Router::add('/posts/:action/*',['controller'=>'Posts']);
```

You can use the same to show a different controller in the url.

```php
Router::add('/posts/:action/*',['controller'=>'BlogPosts']);
```

When you create and use plugins you will need to setup a route for this to work, again this quite straight forward. Lets say you created a demo plugin, this is how you would setup the route.

```php
Router::add('/demo/:controller/:action/*', ['plugin'=>'Demo']);
```

## Request types

You can set specific request types in the route as well.

```php
Router::add('/api/:controller/:action/*',['type'=>'json']);
```
